      <h2>Food Nutritient Identification App</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        <span style="text-decoration: underline; float: left; margin-left: 2%;">Objective:</span><br>
        We are usually not conscious about the amount of
        nutritients present in our daily meals. A Nutrient-Aware Application
        is a software tool designed to help individuals track and manage their
        daily nutrient intake. The primary goal of such an application is to
        promote a healthy and balanced diet by providing users with accurate
        and relevant information about the nutrients present in the food they
        consume. <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        The application can use an ML/DL model trained on a image database of
        foods, which includes the nutritional information for each food item
        such as calorie count, macronutrient breakdown (carbohydrates,
        proteins, and fats), vitamins, and minerals. Users can input the image
        of the food they are about to consume, and the application will
        calculate the total nutrient intake for that meal

      </p>
      <ol style="margin-top: 5%;">
        <b><u>Use Case Scenarios:</u></b>

        <li style="margin-top: 2%;">Click a picture of your plate and upload in the App.</li>
        <li>
          The App should first detect the types of dishes present in that
          plate. (Object Detection or Semantic Segmentation)
        </li>
        <li>
          Quantity of each Dish in the plate (Image based quantity (ml/gms)
          prediction)
        </li>
        <li>
          Create an Excel Sheet where the individual Nutrient component for
          each dish is given. How much of each nutrient is available in this
          particular dish is also reported.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">Create a Chart/Graph for visualization</li>

      <p style="margin-top: 5%;">
        <span style="text-decoration: underline; float: left; margin-left: 2%;">Optional:</span><br>
        The application may also include features such as
        personalized nutrition plans, reminders to drink water, and goals for
        daily nutrient intake based on factors such as age, weight, height,
        and activity level. Some applications may also offer recipe
        suggestions and allow users to track their progress over time.
        Benefits? In addition to individual use, the application can be useful
        for healthcare professionals, nutritionists, and dietitians to monitor
        the nutrient intake of their patients and clients. In conclusion, a
        Nutrient-Aware Application is a valuable tool for promoting a healthy
        diet and lifestyle. With its accurate and comprehensive information,
        it helps individuals make informed decisions about their nutritional
        intake and achieve their health and wellness goals.

      <p>Just storing heaps of lab reports of a patient for years together in form of pdf or image, will not be able to
        help the
        patient or the medical practitioners in any way.
        In order to actually predict a medical codition and to avoid it in advance, it is imperative to properly fetch
        out
        the important information from these lab reports and store them in an excel or csv format for detailed analysis.
        Graphical trends can be generated using these excel files and these trends can help us to identify an upcoming
        serious health
        condition for a patient.

        lab reports of a patient from different sources into single

      <h2>NFT based student attendance system</h2>
      <p>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline; float: left; margin-left: 2%;">Objective:</span><br>

        The objective is to create NFT or smart contract-based gamification system is to improve the process of taking
        student attendance by making it more efficient and fair, while addressing the issue of proxy attendance.

        The game needs to be designed in a way that no student is motivated to apply proxy for any other student. It
        should be an open network where students can mention if someone is absent. The rules should be such that if
        someone is not present in the class and yet he is marking himself present online, others should help the system
        to catch him. Those who help the system to give fair attendance will get rewarded and those who try to cheat the
        system will get penalized.

        <!-- <span style="text-decoration: underline; float: left; margin-left: 2%;">Use Case Scenarios:</span><br>
        1. Record attendance in traditional classrooms and online/virtual classes.
        2. Provide teachers and administrators with an accurate, real-time record of student attendance.
        3. Incentivize consistent attendance through a reward system for students with high attendance.
        4. Track attendance as a factor in determining academic performance.
        5. Those who have cheated ,points will be deducted. -->

          <p style="margin-top: 7%;">

            Automatic evaluation of subjective answers refers to the
            use of algorithms and machine learning techniques to grade or score answer to the question paper from a Subject.
            You can choose the Subject (science, hindi, english, history, geography, social science,) and create the
            Application accordingly. This task can be challenging for machines as subjective answers do not have a single
            correct answer and often involve emotions, personal biases, and cultural differences.
            
            The application can use an ML/DL model trained on a image database of Answer-Sheet, which includes the
            information of Students as well. Several preprocessing steps must be performed, such as cleaning the data and
            tokenization before working on it. Then the textual data can be compared using various techniques such as
            document similarity, latent semantic structures, concept graphs, ontologies. The final score can be evaluated
            based on Similarity, keywords presence, structure, language which involves emotions, personal views and
            differences.
          </p>
            <!-- Use Case Scenarios:
